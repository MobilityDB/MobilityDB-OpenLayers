# Requirements
- npm (version 6.14.13 used in the performance test)
# Build & Tutorial
In order to reproduce this visualization you need to :
1. ```https://github.com/SoufianBk/MobilityDB-OL.git```
2. Execute in the working directory : ```npm install```
3. Run the build script and THEN the execution script : ```npm run build``` and THEN ```npm run start```<br/>
5. Finally to get the result, open the browser on ````localhost:1234````

# Datasets used
The data of Fabrìcio can be found in the following repository : https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB-Deck <br/>
In order to change the data to display, change the variable at the end of ``var file = ...`` which is located at the start of each javascript file for each implementation

# Troubleshooting
When running a script after another, sometimes, the browser does not reload and does not display the wanted execution.
Here are some solutions :
1. Do not forget to run the ``build`` script before running the execution
2. Remove ```.parcel-cache``` and ``dist`` folders (generated by ``npm run``)
3. Clear the browser cache. On firefox just press ```Ctrl + Shift + R```, it will reload the webpage and clears the cache
